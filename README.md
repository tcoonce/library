Dear Mr. Haderman,

I tried my best with this code, but I am out of time. I need to leave campus now if I want to catch my flight. All the code seems to be in place, based off of my previous labs, but values and ViewByIDs don't show up. I am so confused and stressed, but there's nothing else I can do. I hope you understand. Despite how stressful some of the projects could be, this was my favorite class this semester. I hope I can get partial credit for this. I hope you have a Merry Christmas.

From, Tyler Coonce
